# FNS spec - v1.1

## definition

This describes the structure and composition that file and folder names should have.
This spec is saved as a YAML format file.

## storage location

The FNS file is stored in `./.fns/index.yaml` based on the reference folder.
Example: documents/.fns/index.yaml , videos/.fns/index.yaml

## detailed specifications

It must include at least 3 parts without omission, keeping the order, using "---".

```yaml

---

### part1: description of the document

TITLE: yaml example # This is the title of the document. Required field
FNS_VERSION: 1.1 # Version of FNS spec. Required field
date: 2020-01-01 # You can freely add and use this to describe the yaml file. In this case, the key name must use lowercase.

---

### part2: name and path patterns

- folder name: # Ending with ":" indicates it's a folder.
  - subfolder name:   # Tree structure is represented by spaces at the front
  - <pattern1>-<color>  # Patterns are expressed using < and >
    # Self-created pattern names must use lowercase. Uppercase is used for pattern names managed by the specification.

---

### part3: describes various properties for patterns defined in part2. (not required)

EX: # Actual examples that can come in the pattern
  - color: ["black","red","white"]  # Stored as an array.
REG: # Describes patterns that can be expressed as regular expressions.
  - pattern1: '.+'
schema: # You can freely add various properties. In this case, lowercase must be used.
  - color: https://schema.org/color
```

<Aside type="caution">yaml interprets 'no' as false, not as a string. You should input - "no" instead of - no.</Aside>

- Must follow the [YAML Spec](https://yaml.org/spec/).  
- Should include 4 documents as follows:
    1. First document: description of the document
        - Must be a mapping with keys "TITLE" and "FNS_VERSION" (values are string scalars)   
    2. Second document: filename and path patterns 
        - The top-level item must be a block sequence.   
        - The block sequence can contain mappings (representing subfolders) or string scalars (representing files).
        - Mappings must have only one key, which stores the name of the subfolder.
        - The value of a mapping must be either a block sequence (if the subfolder has contents) or empty (if it's an empty folder).
    3. Third document: description of pattern attributes
        - The top-level item is a mapping with multiple keys (REG, EX, etc.) 
        - Each mapping is a block sequence
